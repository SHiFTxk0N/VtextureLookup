 - You'll be first prompted to choose a category. It then displays the amount of IDs available on both online character genders

  - Sometimes it wont be able to display the clothing name but will show "NULL". This means the outfit component exists but it can't be purchased in stores thus no name.

  > For example the noose top on female returns "NULL" because it isnt purchasable seperately in stores
